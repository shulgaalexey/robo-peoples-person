## üéØ Development Workflow

This project uses a **PRP (Project Request Proposal)** system for feature development:

### 1. Planning Phase
- Check `TASK.md` for current priorities
- Review `PLANNING.md` for architecture guidelines
- Use GitHub Copilot Chat for design discussions

### 2. Feature Development
```powershell
# Generate a new PRP for your feature
# Use the template in prompts/commands/generate-prp.md

# Execute the PRP using GitHub Copilot
# Follow prompts/commands/execute-prp.md
```

### 3. Quality Assurance
```powershell
# Code formatting and linting
ruff check --fix; mypy .

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Manual testing (when applicable)
uv run python -m src.main
```

## üîß Development Commands

### Virtual Environment
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1        # Activate environment
deactivate                         # Deactivate environment
```

### Package Management
```powershell
uv add package-name                # Add dependency
uv remove package-name             # Remove dependency
uv sync                            # Sync all dependencies
```

### Code Quality
```powershell
ruff check --fix                   # Format and lint code
mypy .                             # Type checking
black .                            # Code formatting (alternative)
```

### Testing
```powershell
uv run pytest tests/               # Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v            # Verbose test output
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=src     # Run with coverage
```

## ü§ñ AI Agent Architecture

This project is designed to build AI agents using modern Python patterns:

- **Framework**: Pydantic AI for type-safe agent development
- **Async-First**: All agent operations use async/await patterns
- **Tool-Based**: Agents use tools for external interactions
- **Multi-Agent**: Support for agent-to-agent communication
- **Context-Aware**: Maintains conversation context and state

## üìã Task Management

Tasks are managed using a priority-based system in `TASK.md`:

- **P-0**: Immediate tasks (urgent)
- **P-1**: Important tasks (next in line)
- **P-2**: Obligations (no urgency)
- **P-X**: Exciting tasks (motivation boosters)

## üé® Code Style

- **Type Hints**: Required for all function signatures
- **Docstrings**: Google-style for all public functions
- **Max Line Length**: 88 characters (Black default)
- **Max File Length**: 500 lines (refactor if longer)
- **Import Style**: Absolute imports, relative within packages

## üß™ Testing Strategy

- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% required
- **Structure**: Tests mirror main application structure
- **Types**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Pattern**: Happy path, edge cases, and failure scenarios

## üîÑ GitHub Copilot Integration

This project is optimized for GitHub Copilot development:

- **Copilot Chat**: Used for architectural discussions
- **Agent Mode**: `#github-pull-request_copilot-coding-agent` for features
- **Inline Suggestions**: Leveraged for boilerplate code
- **PRP System**: Structured approach for complex features

## üìö Documentation

- **PLANNING.md**: Complete project architecture and conventions
- **TASK.md**: Current tasks and priorities
- **CLAUDE.md**: Claude Code configuration for AI assistance
- **PRPs/**: Feature specifications and implementation guides

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### PowerShell Execution Policy
If you encounter script execution issues:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Virtual Environment Issues
Ensure you're using the correct activation script:
```powershell
# Correct (PowerShell)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Incorrect (Command Prompt style)
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### Package Installation Issues
Clear UV cache if you encounter installation problems:
```powershell
uv cache clean
uv sync
```

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Check `TASK.md` for current priorities
2. Review `PLANNING.md` for architecture guidelines
3. Create a PRP for new features using the templates
