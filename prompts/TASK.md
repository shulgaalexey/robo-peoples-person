# Robo People's Person - Task Management

This file tracks all project tasks using a priority-based system optimized for solo development with AI assistance.

## Task Priority System

- **P-0 (Immediate)**: Urgent tasks that must be tackled right away
- **P-1 (Sooner than Later)**: Important tasks that are next in line after P-0
- **P-2 (Obligations)**: Tasks with no pressing urgency, catch-all category
- **P-X (Excitements)**: Tasks that genuinely excite and motivate

## Current Sprint - January 2025

- [x] Create CLAUDE.md file for project-specific AI assistant configuration
- [x] Validate all PowerShell commands in existing documentation
- [x] Consolidate CLAUDE.md content into copilot-instructions.md and remove CLAUDE.md

### P-1 (Sooner than Later)
- [x] Create initial project README.md with setup instructions
- [ ] Set up basic Python project structure with virtual environment
- [ ] Configure development environment with required tools (ruff, mypy, pytest)
- [x] Create .env.example file with required environment variables

### P-2 (Obligations)
- [ ] Research Pydantic AI framework and best practices
- [ ] Study multi-agent system patterns and implementations
- [ ] Review existing examples in prompts/examples/ directory

- [ ] Configure automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Set up code coverage reporting
- [ ] Create deployment scripts for Windows environment

### Documentation & Examples
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md with Windows setup instructions
- [ ] Add more PRP examples for different types of features
- [ ] Document best practices for Windows development workflow
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common Windows/PowerShell issues

### Agent Development
- [ ] Research and implement authentication/authorization for agents
- [ ] Design data persistence layer for agent conversations
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring for agent interactions
- [ ] Create testing framework specifically for AI agents

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Multi-agent conversation management

## Daily Focus Areas

### Today's Do List
- Complete P-0 tasks (immediate priorities)
- Make progress on P-1 tasks
- Review and update task priorities

### Look Forward To
- Working on P-X tasks (exciting features)
- Experimenting with new AI agent patterns
- Building innovative social interaction features

## Discovered During Work

*Tasks and ideas discovered while working on planned tasks will be added here*

### Research Findings
- TODO.md format can be used for Kanban-style task management
- Markdown-based task management integrates well with Git workflows
- GitHub Copilot agent mode can automate complex feature implementation

### Technical Discoveries
- PowerShell has different command chaining syntax (`;` instead of `&&`)
- Windows virtual environment activation requires `.ps1` scripts
- Pydantic AI requires async patterns throughout the codebase

## Notes & Context

### Current Focus
Building a robust foundation for AI agent development with proper Windows tooling and GitHub Copilot integration.

### Key Decisions Made
1. Prioritize Windows/PowerShell compatibility over cross-platform support
2. Use GitHub Copilot as primary AI assistant for development
3. Implement comprehensive testing from the start
4. Follow modern Python packaging and dependency management practices

### Blockers & Dependencies
- Need to research Pydantic AI framework thoroughly before agent implementation
- Require virtual environment setup before package installation
- Must complete project structure before beginning feature development

## Workflow Integration

This task file is integrated with:
- **PLANNING.md**: Overall project architecture and guidelines
- **CLAUDE.md**: AI assistant configuration for project context
- **GitHub Copilot**: Agent mode integration for automated implementation
- **PRPs**: Feature specifications and implementation guidelines

## Maintenance

- Review and update priorities weekly
- Move completed tasks to "Completed Tasks ✓" section immediately
- Add new discoveries to "Discovered During Work" section
- Keep daily focus areas updated based on current priorities
